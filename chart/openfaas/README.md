# OpenFaaS - Serverless Functions Made Simple

<img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2017/08/faas_side.png" alt="OpenFaaS logo" width="60%">

[OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) (Functions as a Service) is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker and Kubernetes which has first class support for metrics. Any process can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

## Highlights

* Ease of use through UI portal and *one-click* install
* Write functions in any language for Linux or Windows and package in Docker/OCI image format
* Portable - runs on existing hardware or public/private cloud. Native [Kubernetes](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes) support, Docker Swarm also available
* [Operator / CRD option available](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/)
* [faas-cli](http://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) available with stack.yml for creating and managing functions
* Auto-scales according to metrics from Prometheus
* Scales to zero and back again and can be tuned at a per-function level
* Works with service-meshes
    * Tested with [Istio](https://istio.io) including mTLS
    * Tested with [Linkerd2](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/openfaas-linkerd2) including mTLS and traffic splitting with SMI

## Deploy OpenFaaS

### 1) Install with arkade

It is recommended that you use arkade to install OpenFaaS. arkade is a CLI tool which automates the helm CLI and chart download and installation. The `openfaas` app also has a number of options available via `arkade install openfaas --help`

The installation with arkade is as simple as the following which installs OpenFaaS, sets up an Ingress record, and a TLS certificate with cert-manager.

```bash
arkade install openfaas
arkade install openfaas-ingress \
  --domain openfaas.example.com \
  --email wm@example.com
```

See a complete example here: [Get TLS for OpenFaaS the easy way with arkade](https://blog.alexellis.io/tls-the-easy-way-with-openfaas-and-k3sup/)

If you wish to continue without using arkade, read on for instructions.

### 2) Install with helm

These instructions are for Intel (normal computers), jump to the end of the document for ARM and Raspberry Pi.

To use the chart, you will need to use Helm 3:

Get it from arkade:

```bash
arkade get helm
```

Or use the helm3 installer:

```bash
curl -sSLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

We recommend creating two namespaces, one for the OpenFaaS *core services* and one for the *functions*:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faas-netes/master/namespaces.yml
```

You will now have `openfaas` and `openfaas-fn`. If you want to change the names or to install into multiple installations then edit `namespaces.yml` from the `faas-netes` repo.

Add the OpenFaaS `helm` chart:

```sh
helm repo add openfaas https://openfaas.github.io/faas-netes/
```

Now decide how you want to expose the services and edit the `helm upgrade` command as required.

* To use NodePorts (default) pass no additional flags
* To use a LoadBalancer add `--set serviceType=LoadBalancer`
* To use an IngressController add `--set ingress.enabled=true`

> Note: even without a LoadBalancer or IngressController you can access your gateway at any time via `kubectl port-forward`.

## Deploy OpenFaaS Community components

> OpenFaaS PRO customers should read on to the next section.

Now deploy OpenFaaS from the helm chart repo:

```sh
helm repo update \
 && helm upgrade openfaas --install openfaas/openfaas \
    --namespace openfaas  \
    --set functionNamespace=openfaas-fn \
    --set generateBasicAuth=true
```

> The above command will also update your helm repo to pull in any new releases.

Retrieve the OpenFaaS credentials with:

```sh
PASSWORD=$(kubectl -n openfaas get secret basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode) && \
echo "OpenFaaS admin password: $PASSWORD"
```

## Deploy as an OpenFaaS PRO customer

* Create the required secret with your [OpenFaaS PRO license code](https://www.openfaas.com/support/):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic \
    -n openfaas \
    openfaas-license \
    --from-file license=$HOME/.openfaas/LICENSE
```

Now deploy OpenFaaS from the helm chart repo:

```sh
helm repo update \
 && helm upgrade openfaas --install openfaas/openfaas \
    --namespace openfaas  \
    --set functionNamespace=openfaas-fn \
    --set generateBasicAuth=true \
    --set openfaasPro=true
```

The main change here is to add: `--set openfaasPro=true`

* Scale-down to zero (in this document)
* [OpenFaaS PRO SSO/OIDC](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-pro/sso/)
* [OpenFaaS PRO Kafka Event Connector](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-pro/kafka-events/)

#### Generate basic-auth credentials

The chart has a pre-install hook which can generate basic-auth credentials, enable it with `--set generateBasicAuth=true`.

Alternatively, you can set `generateBasicAuth` to `false` and generate or supply the basic-auth credentials yourself. This is the option you may want if you are using `helm template`.

```sh
# generate a random password
PASSWORD=$(head -c 12 /dev/urandom | shasum| cut -d' ' -f1)
kubectl -n openfaas create secret generic basic-auth \
--from-literal=basic-auth-user=admin \
--from-literal=basic-auth-password="$PASSWORD"

echo "OpenFaaS admin password: $PASSWORD"
```

#### Tuning function cold-starts

The concept of a cold-start in OpenFaaS only applies if you A) use faas-idler and B) set a specific function to [scale to zero](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-pro/scale-to-zero/). Otherwise there is not a cold-start, because at least one replica of your function remains available.

There are two ways to reduce the Kubernetes cold-start for a pre-pulled image, which is around 1-2 seconds.

1) Don't set the function to scale down to zero, just set it a minimum availability i.e. 1/1 replicas
2) Use async invocations via the `/async-function/<name>` route on the gateway, so that the latency is hidden from the caller
3) Tune the readinessProbes to be aggressively low values. This will reduce the cold-start at the cost of more `kubelet` CPU usage

To achieve around 1s coldstart, set `values.yaml`:

```yaml
faasnetes:

# redacted
  readinessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 0
    timeoutSeconds: 1
    periodSeconds: 1
  livenessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 0
    timeoutSeconds: 1
    periodSeconds: 1
# redacted
  imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"    # Image pull policy for deployed functions
```

In addition:

* Pre-pull images on each node
* Use an in-cluster registry to reduce the pull latency for images
* Set the `imagePullPolicy` to `IfNotPresent` so that the `kubelet` only pulls images which are not already available
* Explore alternatives such as not scaling to absolute zero, and using async calls which do not show the cold start

#### httpProbe vs. execProbe

A note on health-checking probes for functions:

* httpProbe - (`default`) most efficient. (compatible with Istio >= 1.1.5)
* execProbe - least efficient option, but compatible with Istio < 1.1.5

Use `--set faasnetes.httpProbe=true/false` to toggle between http / exec probes.

### Verify the installation

Once all the services are up and running, log into your gateway using the OpenFaaS CLI. This will cache your credentials into your `~/.openfaas/config.yml` file.

Fetch your public IP or NodePort via `kubectl get svc -n openfaas gateway-external -o wide` and set it as an environmental variable as below:

```sh
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:31112
```

If using a remote cluster, you can port-forward the gateway to your local machine:

```sh
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
kubectl port-forward -n openfaas svc/gateway 8080:8080 &
```

Now log in with the CLI and check connectivity:

```sh
echo -n $PASSWORD | faas-cli login -g $OPENFAAS_URL -u admin --password-stdin

faas-cli version
```

## OpenFaaS Operator and Function CRD

If you would like to work with Function CRDs there is an alternative controller to faas-netes named [OpenFaaS Operator](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/openfaas-operator) which can be swapped in at deployment time.
The OpenFaaS Operator is suitable for development and testing and may replace the faas-netes controller in the future.
The Operator is compatible with Kubernetes 1.9 or later.

To use it, add the flag: `--set operator.create=true` when installing with Helm.

### faas-netes vs OpenFaaS Operator

The faas-netes controller is the most tested, stable and supported version of the OpenFaaS integration with Kubernetes. In contrast the OpenFaaS Operator is based upon the codebase and features from `faas-netes`, but offers a tighter integration with Kubernetes through [CustomResourceDefinitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). This means you can type in `kubectl get functions` for instance.

See also: [Introducing the OpenFaaS Operator](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/kubernetes-operator-crd/)

## Deployment with `helm template`

This option is good for those that have issues with or concerns about installing Tiller, the server/cluster component of helm. Using the `helm` CLI, we can pre-render and then apply the templates using `kubectl`.

1. Clone the faas-netes repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes.git
    cd faas-netes
    ```

2. Render the chart to a Kubernetes manifest called `openfaas.yaml`

    ```sh
    helm template \
      openfaas chart/openfaas/ \
      --namespace openfaas \
      --set basic_auth=true \
      --set functionNamespace=openfaas-fn > openfaas.yaml
    ```

    You can set the values and overrides just as you would in the install/upgrade commands above.

3. Install the components using `kubectl`

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f namespaces.yml,openfaas.yaml
    ```

Now [verify your installation](#verify-the-installation).

## Test a local helm chart

You can run the following command from within the `faas-netes/chart` folder in the `faas-netes` repo.

```sh
helm upgrade openfaas --install chart/openfaas \
    --namespace openfaas \
    --set functionNamespace=openfaas-fn \
    --set generateBasicAuth=true
```

You can override specific images by adding `--set gateway.image=` for instance.

## Exposing services

### NodePorts

By default a NodePort will be created for the API Gateway.

### Metrics

You temporarily access the Prometheus metrics by using `port-forward`

```sh
kubectl --namespace openfaas port-forward deployment/prometheus 31119:9090
```

Then open `http://localhost:31119` to directly query the OpenFaaS metrics scraped by Prometheus.

### LB

If you're running on a cloud such as AKS or GKE you will need to pass an additional flag of `--set serviceType=LoadBalancer` to tell `helm` to create LoadBalancer objects instead. An alternative to using multiple LoadBalancers is to install an Ingress controller.

### Deploy with an IngressController

In order to make use of automatic ingress settings you will need an IngressController in your cluster such as Traefik or Nginx.

Add `--set ingress.enabled` to enable ingress pass `--set ingress.enabled=true` when running the installation via `helm`.

By default services will be exposed with following hostnames (can be changed, see values.yaml for details):

* `gateway.openfaas.local`

### Endpoint load-balancing

Some configurations in combination with client-side KeepAlive settings may because load to be spread unevenly between replicas of a function. If you experience this, there are three ways to work around it:

* [Install Linkerd2](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/openfaas-linkerd2) which takes over load-balancing from the Kubernetes L4 Service (recommended)
* Disable KeepAlive in the client-side code (not recommended)
* Configure the gateway to pass invocations through to the faas-netes provider (alternative to using Linkerd2)

    ```sh
    --set gateway.directFunctions=false
    ```

    In this mode, all invocations will pass through the gateway to faas-netes, which will look up endpoint IPs directly from Kubernetes, the additional hop may add some latency, but will do fair load-balancing, even with KeepAlive.

### SSL / TLS

If you require TLS/SSL then please make use of an IngressController. A full guide is provided to [enable TLS for the OpenFaaS Gateway using cert-manager and Let's Encrypt](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager/).

### Service meshes
If you use a service mesh like Linkerd or Istio in your cluster, then you should enable the `directFunctions` mode using:

```sh
--set gateway.directFunctions=true
```

### Istio mTLS

To install OpenFaaS with Istio mTLS pass  `--set istio.mtls=true` and disable the HTTP probes:

```sh
helm upgrade openfaas --install chart/openfaas \
    --namespace openfaas  \
    --set basic_auth=true \
    --set functionNamespace=openfaas-fn \
    --set exposeServices=false \
    --set faasnetes.httpProbe=false \
    --set httpProbe=false \
    --set gateway.directFunctions=true \
    --set istio.mtls=true
```

The above command will enable mTLS for the openfaas control plane services and functions excluding NATS.

> Note that the above instructions were tested on GKE 1.13 and Istio 1.2

## Zero scale

### Scale-up from zero (on by default)

Scaling up from zero replicas is enabled by default, to turn it off set `scaleFromZero` to `false` in the helm chart options for the `gateway` component.

```sh
--set gateway.scaleFromZero=true/false
```

### Scale-down to zero (off by default)

Scaling down to zero replicas can be achieved either through the REST API and your own controller, or by using the faas-idler component. This is an OpenFaaS PRO feature and an effective way to save costs on your infrastructure costs.

OpenFaaS PRO will only scale down functions which have marked themselves as eligible for this behaviour through the use of a label: `com.openfaas.scale.zero=true`.

See also: [Scale to Zero docs](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-pro/scale-to-zero/).

Check the logs with:

```bash
kubectl logs -n openfaas deploy/faas-idler
```

## Removing the OpenFaaS

All control plane components can be cleaned up with helm:

```sh
helm delete openfaas --namespace openfaas
```

Follow this by the following to remove all other associated objects:

```sh
kubectl delete namespace openfaas openfaas-fn
```

In some cases your additional functions may need to be either deleted before deleting the chart with `faas-cli` or manually deleted using `kubectl delete`.

## ARM and Raspberry Pi

OpenFaaS container images are currently published as multi-arch for ARM64, armhf and `x64_64`. It's recommended that you use [arkade](https://get-arkade.dev) to install, or use the appropriate values.yaml file.

See also: [Kubernetes and Raspberry Pi in the docs](https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/kubernetes)

## Kubernetes versioning

This Helm chart currently supports version 1.16+

Note that OpenFaaS itself may support a wider range of versions, [see here](../../README.md#kubernetes-versions)

## Getting help

Feel free to seek out help using the [OpenFaaS Slack workspace](https://slack.openfaas.io/), please do not raise issues for technical support, unless you suspect and can provide instructions for reproducing an error in the chart.
